> Shapefile attribute format (.dbf)
> This file stores the attributes for each shape; it uses the dBase IV format. The format is public knowledge, and has been implemented in many dBase clones known as xBase. The open-source shapefile C library, for example, calls its format "xBase" even though it's plain dBase IV.
